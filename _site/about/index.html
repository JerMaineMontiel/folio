          <h1>Hi, hello. Welcome to my blog.</h1>
          <p>I’ve been a software engineer for about four years now, though I can’t say I’ve actually done much with that time. My first project I was on at my job, for three of those years, didn’t have much new development that needed to be done. There were things here and there but they began to dwindle; all we had was bug fixes and the project began to ramp down into support mode. The number of engineers slowly decreased, getting loaned and transferred to other groups. I ended up leaving the project in June 2015 and started working with a new group but still haven’t been doing much of coding. I figured I should start creating things on my own.</p>

<p>So, here we are. Currently I’m making decisions on what tools to use on my new side project, and decided maybe I should make a tech blog for myself. The project is a bit out of my comfort zone, so I want to kinda catalogue the things I run into and how I solve them, maybe helping some people along the way. Bear in mind: <em>I have no idea what the fuck I’m doing</em>. Most of the stuff from this point on is brand new to me, but very very exciting. By the end of it I think I’ll have learned a lot, and what I’ve built is something that I’m proud to have my name on. That’s really all I could ask for.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy my posts! They’re gonna be really informal but packed with as much detail as I can give, and resources I can point to. I’m not taking this too seriously, and I’ll try not to bore you. Promise. If you have any questions just shoot me an email at <span>hey@jermaine.fyi</span> or you can hit my <a href="http://twitter.com/jmfyi" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. I’m never not on Twitter.</p>
