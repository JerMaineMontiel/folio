About a year ago, an internet friend and I finally got a chance to meet up after I'd been in Dallas three years already. He had an idea for what's essentially a platform for artists, writers and various kinds of creators to show themselves. We know a lot of the cool, innovative stuff really comes from the fringes -- say, for instance, the hood -- so something grounded in showcasing those exemplary people is sure to be a hit, serving as counterculture (or in our opinion, the return to culture) to the bigger publications dominating the space.

And that's where we're at: [HOODFUTURE](http://hoodfuture.com). As of right now, it's a bit more music-leaning. You can check out the music mixes and not-so-weekly video podcasts the guys have done, but we plan on expanding really quickly in the writing department. The site is built and hosted on Squarespace at the moment (Squarespace is an *awesome* service, by the way) but we're in need of a bit more flexibility when it comes to designing the site. We want to be able to do some really cool things with digital content, so we'll need total autonomy on how we serve it up and build it, that doesn't involve being in different places. We want to be able to build rapidly and with as little friction between development and production as possible. One of the sticking points Squarespace had was, while the templating features of the developer sites is very strong, there was friction in building the site and actually being able to click through and debug what it is you're building. They've recently solved that issue with their [Local Development Server](http://developers.squarespace.com/local-development/), which will be great if and when I use it for other projects. 

The other reason was, I just wanted to do it all myself. As I've said, this is all very new to me. I don't know how to set up a server, I don't know anything about databases, and I've built and designed all of two sites. But I'm doing it. If there's anything I've learned in the past year it's these three things: *Learn more stuff. Build more stuff. Learn more stuff while building more stuff*. That last one is key; I thought I had to learn everything I needed to know and *then* I could build, but I could be doing both at the same time. I mean, that's how you should be learning how to code anyway.

So I'm excited. At the end of it all I'll be able to spin a site up in no time. (and get paid for it!) And just the rush of learning new things and seeing your work in action is just awesome. I feel like I continuously fall in love with coding with every error-free compilation.

Next time, I'll lay out the tools I'm gonna use and why they're a good fit. Hope you come back.
